Persona Segmentation
This project focuses on customer segmentation using a rule-based classification approach. The goal is to define level-based personas and predict the potential revenue from new customers based on their demographic attributes.

  *** Problem Definition
A mobile gaming company wants to:

Analyze its customer data based on platform, gender, country, and age

Group customers into meaningful personas

Segment these personas based on average revenue

Estimate the expected revenue from new potential customers

  *** Dataset
The dataset includes sales transactions with the following columns:

PRICE: Amount of purchase

SOURCE: Platform (e.g., Android, iOS)

SEX: Gender

COUNTRY: Country

AGE: Age of the user

Note: The dataset is not deduplicated. One user may appear multiple times.

  *** Main Tasks

Segmenting customers into Aâ€“D groups

Making revenue predictions for new users

  *** Sample Use Cases
